# schoolAPI-Node-JS-Assignment-main
I have developed Node.js APIs for School Management using **Express.js** and **MySQL**, which allow adding schools and retrieving a list of schools sorted by proximity to a userâ€™s location. The project includes proper input validation, Haversine-based distance calculation, and error handling to ensure reliability.
